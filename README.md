## Networking Tasks
Design and Implementation of a Campus/University System Network Design (Project #1)

__Project #1__  

- Case Study and Requirements
- Albion University is a large university which has two campuses situated 20 miles apart. The university’s students and staff are distributed in 4 faculties; 
these include the faculties of Health and Sciences; 
Business; 
Engineering/Computing and Art/Design. 

Each member of staff has a PC and students have access to PCs in the labs. Create a network topology with the main components to support the following:
University location.

__Main Campus__
- __Building A__: Administrative staff in the departments of management, HR and finance. The admin staff PCs are distributed in the building offices and it is expected that they will share some networking equipment (Hint: use of VLANs is expected here). The Faculty of Business is also situated in this building
- __Building B__: Faculty of Engineering and Computing and Faculty of Art and Design.
- __Building C__: Students’ labs and IT department. The IT department  hosts the University Web  server and other  servers - There is also an email  server hosted externally in the cloud.


Each department/faculty is expected to be on its own separate IP network.
The switches should be configured with appropriate VLANs and security settings.
RIPv2 will be used to provide  routing for the routers in the internal network and static routing for the external server.
The devices in building A will be expected to acquire dynamic IP addresses from a router-based DHCP server.


Configure in Packet Tracer the network with appropriate settings to achieve the connectivity and functionalities specified in the requirements.
